# Radio Rescue Bermuda
You play as the operator of a boat trapped in the alternate reality of the Bermuda Triangle where all the lost ships and planes go. Your job is to rescue as many survivors as you can while avoiding the outlandish sea creatures and strange objects that attack at every opportunity. How long can you last?   

Radio Rescue Bermuda was made in Unity for MayDay Game Jam hosted by MacEwan University's GADEC. The theme was Mayday and we had 48 hours to complete our game.

### Possible intro   
Game starts with a plane flying through a storm, suddenly itâ€™s engine fails and it starts to go down. A mayday call can be heard and then the plane flies through a strange looking portal and crashes into the water. Instead of crashing into a storm churned sea, the plane lands in calm gentle swell water with bright sunshine.
