Game starts with a plane flying through a storm, suddenly it’s engine fails and it starts to go down. A mayday call can be heard and then the plane flies through a strange looking portal and crashes into the water. Instead of crashing into a storm churned sea, the plane lands in calm gentle swell water with bright sunshine.
